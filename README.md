# Netflix-Homepage
Welcome to the Netflix Homepage Clone project! This project is a simple clone of the Netflix homepage designed using only HTML and CSS. It is intended for desktop use only and does not include media queries for responsive design. This project aims to replicate the look and feel of the Netflix homepage. It includes the main sections and styling similar to Netflix, but it does not include any dynamic functionality or responsiveness. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of HTML and CSS for creating a visually appealing web page.
